# List of generic checks (non-specific)

## Authorization

- [ ] Identify Roles
- [ ] Identify sensitive/privileged endpoints
- [ ] Identify authz expectations specific to the business purpose of the app
  * Can non-privileged users view, add, or alter accounts?
  * Is there functionality to add accounts with higher access levels than their own access?
  * How is separation of duties handled?
- [ ] Identify Authorization functions/filtes
  * Do they take Tokens? Cookies? Custom or handled by a framework?

* Broken Access Control
  - [ ] Insecure Direct Object Reference (`find_by`, `find`, `findOne`, `findAll`, etc)
  - [ ] Missing Function Level Access Control
  - [ ] Verify Authorization Filters
  
* Generic authz flaws
  - [ ] Sensitive Data Exposure
  - [ ] Mass Assignment
  - [ ] Business Logic Flaws
  - [ ] Are CSRF Protections applied correctly
  - [ ] Are users forced to re-assert their credentials for requests that have critical side-effect (account changes, password reset, etc)?

## Authentication

* Authentication function checks

- [ ] Password hashing mechanism
- [ ] Timing attacks - this could be username/password or HMAC operations verifying keys
- [ ] Forgot Password
- [ ] 2 factor auth
- [ ] Enumeration... if it matters
- [ ] Signup
- [ ] Brute force attacks
- [ ] Session Management Issues
  - [ ] Session Fixation
  - [ ] Session Destruction
  - [ ] Session Length

* Is there service-to-service authentication?
  - [ ] Constant time comparison function used
  - [ ] HMAC generated using a secure algorithm (basically not SHA1/MD5)
  - [ ] Requests occur over SSL/TLS
    - [ ] Verification of SSL/TLS is not turned off
  - [ ] Reasonable TTL implemented (meaning, an hour or less would be normal.)
  - [ ] Accounts for time skew
  - [ ] Shared secret used and stored in vault (not hardcoded)
  - [ ] Unit-tests for:
    * Check fails if token/hmac/nonce/etc. is missing or mismatched
    * Failure if timestamp is missing or expired
    * Failure if signature verification fails

## Auditing

- [ ] If an exception occurs, does the application fails securely?
- [ ] Do error messages reveal sensitive application or unnecessary execution details?
- [ ] Are Component, framework, and system errors displayed to end user?
- [ ] Does exception handling that occurs during security sensitive processes release resources safely and roll back any transactions?
- [ ] Are relevant user details and system actions logged?
- [ ] Is sensitive user input flagged, identified, protected, and not written to the logs?
  * Credit Card #s, Social Security Numbers, Passwords, PII, keys


## Datastore

- [ ] SQL / NoSQL Injection
- [ ] Key store manipulation (memcache, redis)
- [ ] Validations?
- [ ] Typically where cryptographic operations take place such as generate authentication tokens, hashing passwords, etc.

## File handling

- [ ] How are file uploads stored
- [ ] Security controls?
  - [ ] A/V Scanning
  - [ ] Size / Filetype restrictions
- [ ] How are they retrieved (both Access Control but any sort of traversal or LFI/RFI would be interesting)
