Authn - proving you are who you say you are, Authz - having the authority to take an action

I usually think of authentication is the method used to authorize.

authentication is proving who you are, authorization is proving your access to an object

so even if they protect with HTTPOnly, you can grab it since they save it as a variable, correct?

Oh for sure because you are using the server to set that cookie
3:43
like its supposed to be able to

Nic Gorospe  3:45 PM
well once you grab the session cookie, it's total acct compromise

cktricky  3:46 PM
true true, I just don’t know if the token key/value is the same as session

Nic Gorospe  3:46 PM
ah, gotcha

Jeff  3:49 PM
If the admin and superadmin checks are based on the session, would be interesting to try to change the session token to change those.
